Validation is key to successful online forms. Implementing dynamic form validation that reacts to input can be difficult to implement with languages like JavaScript and jQuery. However, AngularJS allows you to take advantage of two-way data-binding functionality without having to write any JavaScript code. This makes reacting to input from the user—as it happens—a breeze.

In this short course, Ray Villalobos shows how to implement form validation on any HTML form using the built-in validation properties and methods in AngularJS. Together, you'll look at how AngularJS can help style forms dynamically as the user updates the content. Plus, explore how to implement validation with JavaScript, just in case you need more fine-tuned control of form interactions.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
